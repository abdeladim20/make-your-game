            <h1>SPACE INVADERS</h1>
            <p>You are the last pilot, a courageous volunteer tasked with one impossible mission: hold the line.
                Armed with nothing but your skill and the X-42,
                you must face waves of enemy fleets,
                destroy the mothership, and drive back the invaders before Earth falls.

                The survival of humanity rests on you. Will you be Earth's hero—or its final memory?</p>

            <h1>Victory… For Now</h1>
            <p>
                You've crushed the enemy wave, proving your skill and resilience.
                But this battle was only a prelude to the real challenge ahead.
                The mothership looms in the distance, a fortress of steel and fire,
                guarding the final key to Earth's survival.

                Brace yourself, pilot. The true fight begins now.
                Good luck—you'll need it.
            </p>

            <button id="next" class="btn">Head to the Mothership!</button>

        <div id="story" class="late">
            <h1>Mission Accomplished</h1>
            <p>
                The battle is over. The mothership erupts into a brilliant fireball,
                its wreckage scattering into the void. The invasion is over—Earth is safe.

                You have defied the odds, a lone pilot against an armada.
                The Earth will remember this day.

                As you drift among the stars, the silence is deafening.
                But the war has taught you one thing: peace is never permanent.

                For now, you are a hero. But when the next threat comes… will you be ready?
