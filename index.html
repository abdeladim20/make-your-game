            <h1>SPACE INVADERS</h1>
            <p>You are the last pilot, a courageous volunteer tasked with one impossible mission: hold the line.
                Armed with nothing but your skill and the X-42,
                you must face waves of enemy fleets,
                destroy the mothership, and drive back the invaders before Earth falls.

                The survival of humanity rests on you. Will you be Earth's hero—or its final memory?</p>

            <h1>Victory… For Now</h1>
            <p>
                You've defeated the enemy wave, but the battle is far from over.  
                Ahead lies a deadly asteroid field, a treacherous barrier between you and the mothership.  
                Navigate through the chaos, dodge the debris, and brace yourself for the final confrontation.  
                Earth's fate hangs in the balance.

            <h1>The Final Approach</h1>
            <p>
                You've skillfully navigated the deadly asteroid field, emerging unscathed against the odds.  
                Ahead, the mothership looms larger than ever, its defenses primed and waiting.  
                This is it—the final stand. Prepare for the ultimate battle that will decide Earth's fate.  
            </p>

        <div id="story" class="late">
            <h1>Mission Accomplished</h1>
            <p>
                The battle is over. The mothership erupts into a brilliant fireball,
                its wreckage scattering into the void. The invasion is over—Earth is safe.

                You have defied the odds, a lone pilot against an armada.
                The Earth will remember this day.

                As you drift among the stars, the silence is deafening.
                But the war has taught you one thing: peace is never permanent.

                For now, you are a hero. But when the next threat comes… will you be ready?
